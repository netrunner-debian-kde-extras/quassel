quassel (0.10.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The certificate in /var/lib/quassel/quasselCert.pem was accessible by
  all local users on this server which allows users to decipher traffic between
  quassel core and connected clients.
  We suggest to generate a new certificate to ensure secure communication.
