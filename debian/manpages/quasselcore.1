.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B Quassel IRC
is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core -- much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, but graphical. In addition to this uniqe feature, we aim to bring a pleasurable, comfortable chatting experience to all major platforms (including Linux\(rg, Windows\(rg, and MacOS X\(rg as well as Qtopia-based cell phones and PDAs), making communication with your peers not only convenient, but also ubiquitous available.
