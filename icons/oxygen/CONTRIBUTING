If you'd like to help us make Oxygen or contribute in any way please join the irc channel #kde-artists on freenode.net or send a mail to the kde-artists mailing list (artists@kde.org). One of the teeam is almost always online. We'd love to to discuss the possiblity with you :-)

In order to coordinate the addition of icons to the theme itself, all artists should put their work in a dir labelled Oxygen/ARTIST_NAME (so, mine for instance is Oxygen/Ken/) this allows us to control not only the licensing of the theme but the compatability with the guidelines for creating Oxygen icons.

NOTE:
Contributors should realize that the Oxygen icon theme mantainers can (and probably will) modify, delete, reuse contributed artwork.
